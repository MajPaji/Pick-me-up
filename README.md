# [Pick Me Up](https://pick-me-up-project.herokuapp.com/) (Milestone project 4)

## Introduction

[Pick-me-up](https://pick-me-up-project.herokuapp.com/) is a python based application website, developed with the Django framework.
  This website aims to sell coffee and cocoa beans. 
  Yes, these are from two different plants, but they have a very similar aim; to stimulate and energize. 
  The name of the website can brilliantly imply these. Pick-me-up can be indicated a webshop to pick up and 
  buying something. Also, it can simply be stimulating and energizing (if you stress it on me! word).

The coffee and chocolate industry evolved rapidly over the years. 
The mass production of the beans caused lower quality. 
This website aims to sell the better quality of these two amazing fruits.
